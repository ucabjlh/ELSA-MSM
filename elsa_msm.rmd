    # one cause of poor model fit is the failure of the Markov assumption, that is, the transition intensities may depend on the time spent in the current state (a semi-Markov process) or other characteristics of the processs history. Semi-Markov models may in principle be fitted to this type of data using phase-type distrbutions. See help(msm) for details
    # Pearson-type goodness-of-fit; if true transition times are unknown, and data consist of observations of the process at arbitrary times which differ between individuals. Only advisable if observation times are close together. An alternative is to construct tables of observed and expected numbers of transitions, leading to a formal test of goodness of fit, analogous to pearson x2 test for contingency tables.
